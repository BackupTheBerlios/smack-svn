Smack Drum Synth.

What is is?

A drum synth ;-) 100% sample free. Written as patches for the Om modular synth. You need the latest cvs version of Om and any recent swh-plugins, omins, blop-plugins and cmt-plugins to use them. Maybe others too... If it does work first check your ladspa plugins. Patches arn't meant to be just presets, play with the knobs. Some patches such as the hihats are heavy on cpu, i'm working on it. More docs coming soon.
