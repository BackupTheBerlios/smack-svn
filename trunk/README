This is the 808/909/fm prototype patches for smack. They are patches for the Om modular synth. You need the latest cvs version of Om, swh-plugins, blop-plugins and cmt-plugins to use them. Patches currently don't have decent presets, play with the knobs. Some patches esp 909 are heavy on cpu, i'm working on it. 
The plugin included is still very fresh! watch out... and not proper id yet....

This is more likely to explode than not, but it work here for me ;-) Feel free to email me with improvements, new drums,etc.
